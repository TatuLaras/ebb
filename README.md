# Ebb (working title)
A little personal game project I use as a creative outlet.
It's supposed to become a minimalist fantasy game with a tiny world that feels big.
The game features 1990-2000 style assets with vertex lighting to give off that specific vibe.
This README page will be updated with more information as this project progresses.

## Tools
To make this project fun, I'm choosing to develop this game in a very suckless way with just Raylib and C.
To accomplish some of the game-enginy things I make my own tools, which are listed below:

- [Bricklayer](https://github.com/TatuLaras/bricklayer): A simple model viewer with hot-reloading capabilites to simplify texture editing with Aseprite
- [Noble](https://github.com/TatuLaras/noble): A scene editor (lighting, assets, skybox)
